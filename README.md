# M5451LED is an Arduino Shield with an 8 digit LED display and 14 additional Outputs. It is based on the M5451 40 pin Dip IC. The IC basically works as a shift register with 35 output lines. Each line can sink about 25mA which allows it to directly drive LEDs. 21 Lines are used for the display segments and digit selection in a multiplexed fashion. The additional 14 outputs are available on a 20 postion header allowing expansion of the shield. The shield uses only 2 data lines from the arduino for (clock and data). The M5451.zip file is the Arduino libaray and 2 example programs for the shield. The first is a straight loop approach for updating the display, the second is an itnerrupt based approach for updating the display.
